# Badger-NFT-Gitcoin-Contest
Containing the proposal about the model design, and the code for automatically generator based on the model.

Check **[this page](https://jitrz.github.io/Badger-NFT-Gitcoin-Contest)** for complete proposal.

You need just _numpy random_ library and _pandas_ library to run the python code.

Any feedback and idea about improving this repo is welcome. Thank you!
